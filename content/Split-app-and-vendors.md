When your application is depending on other libraries, especially large ones like React JS, you should consider splitting those dependencies into its own vendors bundle. This will allow you to do updates to your application, without requiring the users to download the vendors bundle again. Use this strategy when:

- When your vendors reaches a certain percentage of your total app bundle. Like 20% and up 
- You will do quite a few updates to your application
- You are not too concerned about perceived initial loading time, but you do have returning users and care about optimizing the experience when you do updates to the application
- Users are on mobile

*webpack.production.config.js*
```javascript
var path = require('path');
var webpack = require('webpack');
var node_modules_dir = path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules');

var config = {
  entry: {
    app: path.resolve(__dirname, 'app/main.js'),
    
    // Since react is installed as a node module, node_modules/react,
    // we can point to it directly, just like require('react');
    vendors: ['react']
  },
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'app.js'
  },
  module: {
    loaders: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: [node_modules_dir],
      loader: ['babel']
    }]
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin('vendors', 'vendors.js')
  ]
};

module.exports = config;
```
This configuration will create two files in the `dist/` folder. **app.js** and **vendors.js**.

#### Important!
Remember to add both files to your HTML file, or you will get the error: `Uncaught ReferenceError: webpackJsonp is not defined`.
